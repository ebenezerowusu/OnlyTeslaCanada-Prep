                  No. All negotiations, payments, and contracts occur strictly between you and the seller. It’s free to register and to search for used Teslas, and there are no hidden fees.

                  In the future, we’ll be implementing a video chat feature that will help by letting you see the buyer, seller, or used Tesla live. Until then, we recommend you use a third-party service such as Skype for video chats. You can also ask for the seller to provide proof of the Extended Service Agreement (ESA), if applicable. If you’re ever unsure of the integrity of the person you're dealing with, or the vehicle in question, don’t sign anything. Be careful, communicate frequently, and trust your intuition.

                  In some cases buyers and sellers may choose to provide you with their personal contact information to facilitate the process, and in the future, we’ll be implementing video chat and messaging features for users.

                  The buyer and seller arrange this with each other as part of the purchase. In most cases, the cost of transporting the used Tesla is a separate cost from the purchase price, and you should take the time to discuss these details before you sign anything. We stay out of your purchase.

              At Only Used Tesla, we've pioneered the first marketplace exclusively designed for buying and selling pre-owned Tesla vehicles. These aren't just ordinary cars; Tesla vehicles redefine luxury, marrying advanced technology with sustainable travel. However, we recognize that factors like restrictive dealership practices, hefty price tags of new-age technology, or an insufficient supply due to soaring demand can deter potential owners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our platform breaks down barriers, creating an accessible marketplace for those looking to sell your Tesla or find a used Tesla for sale. We uniquely facilitate seamless transactions between Tesla enthusiasts and prospective owners, eliminating the challenges traditionally associated with acquiring these innovative machines.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a dedicated platform for Tesla resales, we proudly stand as one of the rare, if not the only, venues focused on offering used Teslas. Our mission revolves around making pre-owned Teslas more accessible to enthusiasts and aspiring owners alike. So, if you're scouring the market for a used Tesla for sale from a private seller or dealer, your search ends here at Only Used Tesla.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, if you're planning to sell your Tesla, we provide an efficient and effective platform, ensuring your vehicle finds a new home with someone who will appreciate it just as much as you have. Choose Only Used Tesla – where Tesla ownership dreams become reality.
